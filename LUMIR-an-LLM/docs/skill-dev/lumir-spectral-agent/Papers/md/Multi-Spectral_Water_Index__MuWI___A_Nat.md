## Abstract

Spectral Indices derived from multispectral remote sensing products are extensively used to monitor Earth system dynamics (e.g. vegetation dynamics, water bodies, fire regimes). The rapid increase of proposed spectral indices led to a high demand for catalogues of spectral indices and tools for their computation. However, most of these resources are either closed-source, outdated, unconnected to a catalogue or lacking a common Application Programming Interface (API). Here we present "Awesome Spectral Indices" (ASI), a standardized catalogue of spectral indices for Earth system research. ASI provides a comprehensive machine readable catalogue of spectral indices, which is linked to a Python library. ASI delivers a broad set of attributes for each spectral index, including names, formulas, and source references. The catalogue can be extended by the user community, ensuring that ASI remains current and enabling a wider range of scientific applications. Furthermore, the Python library enables the application of the catalogue to real-world data and thereby facilitates the efficient use of remote sensing resources in multiple Earth system domains.

Background & Summary
The constant monitoring of surface processes is a prerequisite for understanding Earth System’s dynamics and 
functioning1–6. The big expansion of freely available remote sensing resources6–8 opens unprecedented opportu-
nities for exploring interactions between the Earth’s surface and electromagnetic radiation. As new sensors come 
in ever higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions, we constantly gain better insights into different Earth 
sub-systems. Surface materials have characteristic spectral signatures due to their physical properties and their 
interactions with electromagnetic radiation. As environmental effects can modify these interactions, spectral 
signatures give some insights into different surface processes, e.g., vegetation states
9, urban expansion5,10, fires, 
and burned areas11,12. However, often one has to combine specific spectral regions of interest (i.e., spectral bands) 
in order to reduce unwanted (i.e., confounding effects) when studying a certain phenomenon or material13–16. 
Such combinations of bands, named spectral indices, supply condensed information on specific sub-systems, 
materials, or processes. For different application domains, multiple proposals for ideal spectral indices exist, and 
the field is constantly developing and testing novel spectral indices.
The most common application domain of spectral indices is the terrestrial biosphere, with a special focus 
on vegetation monitoring via Vegetation Indices (VI). Typically, VIs use spectral information (i.e., reflectance) 
from the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, exploiting the chlorophyll 
absorption bands and plant structural features for assessing vegetation states
17. Along these lines, multiple 
VIs have been created, and the total number of indices has been growing steadily through time 17,18. The most 
renowned and applied VI is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)13, computed as the normalized

difference between NIR and red reflectances, and generally used to assess vegetation greenness in space and 
time. Variants have also been developed by incorporating additional correction factors, such as the canopy 
background adjustment parameter in the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)
14, which reduces soil brightness 
effects. Some spectral indices have even been designed to serve as correction factors for scattering effects in Solar 
Induced Fluorescence (SIF), e.g., Fluorescence Correction Vegetation Index (FCVI)
19 and Hyperspectral NIRv 
(NIRvH)20.
The goal of developing VIs specifically suited for a more accurate mapping of dynamic ecosystem processes, 
such as gross primary production (GPP , i.e., gross carbon uptake by plants)6, has led to a particularly wide vari-
ety of indices. The NIR Reflectance of Vegetation (NIRv)21 as well as the generalized Kernel NDVI (kNDVI)22 are 
examples of novel indices that aim to serve as a proxy for GPP . New sensors are capable of retrieving the reflec-
tance in the red edge, which is highly sensitive to chlorophyll content due to the chlorophyll absorption shift to 
a longer wavelength. This led to a new set of indices around these bands. For instance, the Medium Resolution 
Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI)
23 was created from the red and red edge 
bands of the sensor on board the Envisat satellite and served as a proxy for estimating the Red Edge Position, 
also known as the Red Edge Point (REP), which is used for estimating canopy chlorophyll content. In particular, 
the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on board Sentinel-2 satellites enables the computation of red edge indices, 
such as the Inverted Red Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI) as well as the Sentinel-2 REP (S2REP)
24.
Indices for other application domains also contribute to the growing list of spectral indices. Water Indices 
(WI) generally use reflectance from the green, NIR and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands to discriminate water 
bodies from other land cover types such as soil, vegetation, or constructed surfaces
25. One of the most used WIs 
is the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)16, computed as the normalized difference between green and 
NIR reflectances for delineating water bodies. Variants of this index, such as the Modified NDWI (MNDWI)26, 
have been created by replacing the NIR for SWIR reflectance, particularly reducing the influence of the noise 
produced by built-up areas. The number of WIs is also increasing due to the launching of new satellites and 
enhanced sensors. The Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI)
27 was developed for images of the Operational Land 
Imager (OLI) sensor of Landsat-8, while the Sentinel-2 Water Index (S2WI)28 was created by taking advantage 
of the red edge bands in Sentinel-2 MSI imagery.
Modifications of existent indices as well as the development of new sensors with additional bands or dif -
ferent spectral characteristics are the main reasons for the growth of new spectral indices in other application 
domains. Besides WIs, indices for identifying burned areas and active fires are being expanded. For instance, 
the Burned Area Index (BAI)
29, one of the most used indices for detecting fire-affected areas, initially devel -
oped for the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument, has recently been modified 
to match Sentinel-2 MSI spectral bands (BAIS2)
30. BAIS2 uses red edge bands as well as the narrow NIR band. 
Another example is snow and ice cover indices. The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)15 was developed 
for the Landsat’s Thematic Mapper (TM) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 
instruments using the green and SWIR bands, while one of the newest indices, the Snow Water Index (SWI)
31, 
developed for Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI instruments, additionally use the NIR band aiming to discrim-
inate better between snow cover and water bodies. This is also the case of Urban and Soil Indices. The Urban 
Index (UI)
32, developed to map urban areas and investigate urban density and socio-economic variables, was 
constructed using images from the Landsat TM instrument. Contemporaneous indices such as the Dry Built-Up 
index (DBI)
33 use the Thermal Infrared (TIR) band from the Landsat OLI instrument to improve the discrimi-
nation of built-up areas and bare soil in dry climates. Likewise, Soil Indices like the Bareness Index (BaI)34 were 
created for detecting the degree of bareness on the surface using bands from Landsat TM. By using bands from 
Landsat OLI, new indices such as the Modified Bare Soil Index (MBI)
35 and the Enhanced MBI (EMBI)5 have 
been developed, which particularly suppress built-up areas when detecting bare soil areas.
The steady growth of spectral indices across application domains inevitably calls for a central repository, 
gallery, or catalogue, where the remote sensing community can explore the vast amount of indices for spe -
cific applications or analyses. Arguably, one of the most comprehensive catalogues of spectral indices is the 
Index DataBase (IDB)
36,37, which has condensed several indices in a relational data model, specially VIs, as 
well as multiple attributes such as their formula, acronym, original name, used bands for different sensors and 
a collection of articles that cite most of the indices. The IDB includes a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
Application Programming Interface (API) for querying spectral indices, which can be used upon request. 
Specifically for VIs, the review article by Xue et al ., (2017)
18 presents a comprehensive review of several VIs, 
including their formulas and references. Proprietary software, such as ArcGIS and ENVI, count with their own 
spectral indices gallery (see https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/imagery/indices-gallery.htm and 
 
https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/docs/alphabeticallistspectralindices.html, respectively). While they exhibit 
formulas, descriptions, and references, and can be accessed freely online, they require a license to compute 
them. There are few open-source projects providing tools to calculate spectral indices. Examples include the 
RadiometricIndices application from Orfeo Toolbox
38 (see https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/
Applications/app_RadiometricIndices.html); the Vegetation Indices tools from SAGA-GIS 39 (see https://
saga-gis.sourceforge.io/saga_tool_doc/8.4.1/imagery_tools.html ); the spectralIndices function from 
RStoolbox (see https://bleutner.github.io/RStoolbox/rstbx-docu/spectralIndices.html), which is written in 
C and works with raster objects in R; the nightmares package, which also leverages the computation of 
spectral indices inside R (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nightmares/index.html); and the mul
-
tispectral module from xarray-spatial (see https://xarray-spatial.org/reference/multispectral.html), 
which works with dask for xarray.DataArray objects
40 in Python. However, all the above mentioned 
open-source projects implement outdated sets of hard-coded indices that are not connected to a standardized 
open community catalogue.

Despite the fact that numerous resources have been developed for querying and computing spectral indices, 
multiple barriers still abridge the remote sensing community from exploiting them: The first obstacle is the out-
dated proprietary-dependent set of indices. The lack of novel spectral indices prevents users from making the 
most of spectral features that are offered by today’s instruments. This hurdle grows bigger as multiple resources 
have a limited amount of indices in their catalogues, depriving users not just from novel, but also from tradi
-
tional, as well as rare spectral indices. As the number of indices continues to increase, the remote sensing com-
munity requires an easy way to implement indices on their own on demand. The second obstacle is that spectral 
indices toolboxes are not connected to an existent open-source catalogue and indices are usually hard-coded 
inside specific modules. While this is not a major issue for open-source resources where the community can 
contribute by adding new indices, it is a stumbling block for non-developers who need a quick way to compute 
spectral indices that are not included yet. Vice versa, catalogues that are not linked to a toolbox are not entirely 
harnessing their potential by providing an application that the community may use to query and compute the 
included spectral indices.
The aim of this paper is to present “ Awesome Spectral Indices” (ASI), an open community catalogue for 
handling spectral indices in Earth System research that addresses the research gap described above. ASI com
-
prises a spectral indices catalogue, which is connected to a Python library. The catalogue of spectral indices is 
a free-to-access online open-source repository that follows a basic key-value structure and a simple standard 
for spectral indices in different application domains. The catalogue’s straightforward architecture allows the 
community to request or add new indices as they become available. The Python library, named spyndex, uses 
the catalogue to create an user-friendly module for querying and automatically computing spectral indices for 
multiple Python objects (e.g. arrays and data frames). ASI leverages the data model structure as well as a Python 
library for easy management of spectral indices for their use in the analysis of Earth’s surface processes using 
remote sensing data streams.
Methods
Catalogue design. Data model. The catalogue is designed as a simple nested key-value model (Fig. 2b) that 
stores attributes for multiple spectral indices. For simplicity, the set of spectral indices (represented by the acronyms 
as string objects) is defined as ψψΨ= ...{, ,} n1 , where ψ is a spectral index and n is the number of indices in the 
list. The set of application domains is defined as O = {≪ vegetation≫, ≪ water≫, ≪ burn≫ , ≪ snow≫ , ≪ urban≫, 
≪ soil≫ , ≪ radar≫, ≪ kernel≫ }. The catalogue is formally defined as ψψ= ...ψψC AA{( ,) ,, (, )}n1 n1
, where C is 
the catalogue, ψ is a spectral index and ψ ∈Ψ , Aψ  is the set of attributes of ψ and n is the number of indices in C. 
Each index ψ is the primary key of the model and the corresponding value Aψ  is a set of 9 attributes represented by a 
secondary key-value model (Fig. 2c) such that

where ψ  is the short name (i.e., acronym) of the index and ψ ∈Ψ , ηψ  is the long name (i.e., original name) of the 
index, oψ  is the application domain of the index and ∈ψo O, Eψ  is the expression of the index, Vψ  is the set of 
operands in Eψ  and ⊆ψVV  (see Expressions section), ψZ  is the set of platforms with the required bands for the 
index computation, rψ  is the URL or DOI of the reference of the index, ψd  is the date of addition to C, and cψ  is the 
URL of the contributor’s GitHub profile.
Contributors must fill all attributes of an index except Vψ  and Zψ , which are extracted automatically after Eψ  
is validated. The set of platforms ψZ  is filled up taking ψV  into account. If a platform ∈zZ  counts with the 
required bands for a spectral index computation, that is, VV z⊆ψ , the platform z is added to Zψ . As of version 
0.4.0, the set of platforms Z  is { ≪ MODIS ≫ , ≪ Landsat-TM≫ , ≪ Landsat-ETM +≫ , ≪ Landsat-OLI≫ , 
≪Sentinel-2≫, ≪Sentinel-1 (Dual HH-HV)≫, ≪Sentinel-1 (Dual VV-VH)≫, ≪Planet-Fusion≫}. Note that 
platforms with the same sensors (or spectral bands) were grouped (e.g. ≪Landsat-TM≫  refers to the group of 
the Landsat 4 and 5 satellites).
Expressions. An expression E  is a string object that can be parsed as a representation of an operation (e.g. 
≪ a + b≫  is an expression representing the a + b mathematical operation, where ≪a≫  and ≪b≫  are operands, 
and ≪ +≫  is an operator). Given this, a well defined valid expression can be easily evaluated in any program-
ming language, leveraging the need to re-write each spectral index for all languages where spectral indices can 
be implemented.
To establish a standard expression evaluation model, all possible expression operands V and operators G in 
spectral indices must follow a standard naming. The complete set of standards is given by ∪=S VG . Given this,

bands, additional parameters, band dependent parameters, and common operators require a well defined stand-
ard. G was created from the standard operators ≪ +≫ , ≪ − ≫ , ≪*≫, and ≪ /≫ , that were used for addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division operations, respectively. The ≪**≫ operator was used for exponentia-
tion operations instead of ≪ ˆ≫  to make it compatible with Python. V was created from the bands of popular

multispectral sensors in satellite remote sensing platforms, therefore, each standard name corresponds to a band 
in one of these platforms (Table 2). The standard names were kept as short as possible, representing them in most 
of cases as a single character in capital letters to avoid large string expressions. When more than one band for the 
same region is encountered, a consecutive number is added at the end of the standard name. For Radar indices, 
the standards ≪ HH≫ , ≪ HV≫ , ≪ VV≫ , and ≪ VH≫  were created for the corresponding polarization mode 
no matter the wavelength (e.g. C-band of the C-SAR instrument on Sentinel-1 satellites).
This standardization accounts for spectral indices that do not require any additional parameters, such as the 
NDVI:
ρρ ρρ=− +NDVI () /( ) (2)NIRr ed NIRr ed
where ρi is the reflectance in band i . Equation  2 is represented by ≪≫E (N R)/(NR )NDVI =− +  using S , 
where VNDVI = {≪ N≫ , ≪ R≫ ,}. Nevertheless, additional parameters must also be standardized for spectral indi-
ces that require them. These parameters are standardized according to the notation used in the original index, 
keeping the standard names as similar as possible to the original parameters no matter the length, and using the 
name of greek letters when encountered, e.g., the weighting coefficient α in the Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation 
Index (WDRVI)
41 is represented by the standard name ≪alpha≫  (Table 3). Band dependent parameters, such 
as band wavelengths λi and kernels K(a, b) were standardized by using the common names ≪ lambdaA≫  and 
≪kAB≫, where ≪lambdaA ≫ is the wavelength of band A and ≪kAB≫ is a kernel function of A and B (being 
A and B band reflectances or other additional parameters).
By using these additional standard names, spectral indices like the Hyperspectral Near-Infrared Reflectance 
of Vegetation (NIRvH2)20 are also accounted for. Given this, the equation:
kNIRvH2 () (3)NIRr ed NIRr edρρ λλ=− −× −
where k is the soil slope between red and NIR and λi is the wavelength of band i, is represented by the expression 
≪≫=− −− ∗E NR k( lambdaNl ambdaR)NIRvH2 , where VNIRvH2 = {≪ N≫ , ≪ R≫ , ≪ k≫ , ≪ lambdaN≫ , 
≪ lambdaR≫ }. The ≪N≫  and ≪ R≫  characters in the ≪ lambdaN≫  and ≪ lambdaR≫  expressions have no 
conflicts with the ρNIR and ρred standards since the complete expression is parsed as a single variable as long as it 
doesn’t have any spaces or operators. This principle also applies to generalized kernel indices such as the kNDVI:
ρρ ρρ
ρρ ρρ
=
−
+
KK
KK
kNDVI
(, )( ,)
(, )( ,) (4)
NIRN IR NIRr ed
NIRN IR NIRr ed
where K(ρi, ρj) is a kernel function of the reflectances in bands i and j. Equation 4 is represented by the expres-
sion ≪≫E (kNN kNR)/(kNNk NR)kNDVI =− +  using S, where VkNDVI = {≪ kNN≫ , ≪ kNR≫ }. This stand-
ard has no conflicts with the standard of raw reflectances and allows the optimization of generalized kernel 
indices by enabling the free choice of the kernel function as well as their parameters.
Release. After validation (see Technical Validation), all indices are exported as a JSON file by keeping the 
original nested key-value model and the GitHub repository is updated. Additionally, the JSON file is used to 
convert the nested key-value model to a relational model exported as a CSV file. This model permits the use 
of the catalogue as a tabular structure that can be easily read as a data frame datatype in many programming 
languages (e.g. R and Julia). Furthermore, it can be loaded as a table using a Relational Database Management 
System (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, allowing the use of the domain specific SQL language for querying the

Python library design. spyndex is an open-source Python package hosted in GitHub that works as the 
Python library for ASI (Fig. 2f). This package allows users to query and compute spectral indices from the cata-
logue. The spectral indices are automatically updated in the spyndex repository once they are released by keep-
ing a local copy of the JSON file provided by the catalogue itself (Fig. 2i). This allows users to access and compute 
spectral indices even if they don’t have an internet connection. Nevertheless, users can still use the most recent 
version of the catalogue for spectral indices computation if an internet connection is provided.
Querying spectral indices and parameters. The local copy of the JSON file is used to create a new class named 
SpectralIndex. This class stores the attributes of each index in the catalogue and saves them as its own 
attributes. Additionally, this class counts with a method for computing the index by passing the required param-
eters as a dictionary object or as keywords arguments. By using this class, each index in the local copy of the

catalogue is transformed to a SpectralIndex object that can be accessed and computed directly. All trans-
formed indices are then stored in a SpectralIndices object, which is constructed by inheritance from the 
Box class167, allowing indices querying by using dot notation and text auto-completion (Fig. 2h).
Standards for band reflectances also have a new specific class for querying information relative to different 
satellite platforms and their specifications. The Band class is created to store the ≪ standard≫  and ≪ long_
name≫  attributes, which users can access from the specific band. Additionally, the attributes ≪ sentinel2a≫ , 
≪ sentinel2b≫ , ≪ landsat4≫ , ≪ landsat5≫ , ≪ landsat7≫ , ≪ landsat8≫ , ≪ landsat9≫  and ≪ modis≫  are also 
created for each band, containing information on the band name, band number, center wavelength (nm) and 
bandwidth (nm) for each specific platform in a class named PlatformBand. The Band class is useful for 
the computation of indices that require the specific platform band wavelengths λ
i such as the NIRvH2 and the 
Normalized Difference Greenness Index (NDGI)159. All bands are then stored in a Bands object, also inherited 
from the Box class to allow the use of dot notation and auto-completion (Fig. 2h).
Additional parameters (Table  3) that also follow a standard naming are included in a new class named 
Constant. This class stores the ≪ standard ≫ , ≪ long_name≫  and ≪ default≫  attributes, representing 
the standard name, the original name and the default value of the parameter. Furthermore, specific kernel 
parameters were also included here for the calculation of kernel indices. These kernel parameters include the 
length-scale parameter σ for the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel KRBF (Eq. 7), and the polynomial degree p 
and the trade-off parameter c in the Polynomial Kernel Kpoly (Eq. 6). By using this class, users can decide whether 
to use the default values for the additional parameters, or to optimize them by using any other value or a compat-
ible Python object. This becomes handy when computing indices that require additional parameters such as the 
Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)
90 and the Optimized Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (OCVI)141, among others. 
All parameters are stored in a Constants object inherited from a Box class for their access using dot notation 
and text auto-completion (Fig. 2h).
Computing spectral indices.  In Python, a single string expression can be evaluated as f (E, P), where f  is the 
evaluation function, E is the expression to evaluate, and P is a dictionary of local variables that serve as inputs for 
undefined variables in E. Since EA ∈ψψ  is a valid expression that was curated in the catalogue validation pro-
cess, it can be used without any modification to compute a spectral index by being evaluated. This evaluation is 
performed by passing the required parameters ψV  for the formula computation as interoperable Python objects 
that support mathematical overloaded operators. This means that the evaluation process is successful for objects 
with mathematical overloaded operators that perform the actual mathematical operations (e.g. a ≪+≫  operator 
performs an addition for two integers), but it will fail for objects with mathematical overloaded operators that do 
not perform the actual mathematical operations (e.g. a ≪+≫ operator performs a concatenation for two lists).
By this definition, spectral indices can be computed by taking advantage of the expression evaluation process 
in Python. A single spectral index ψ  can then be evaluated by 
ψψf EP(, ), where Eψ  is the expression of the  
spectral index ψ  and ψP  is the dictionary of parameters required to evaluate the index expression such  
that P {( ,) ,, (, )}n n1 1υρ υρ= ...ψ , where υ ∈ ψVi  and ρ i is the reflectance of band i  as a compatible  
Python object. For example, to calculate the NDVI (Eq.  2) it is required to compute f EP(, )NDVI NDVI ,  
where ≪≫E (N R)/(NR )NDVI =− + , and ≪≫ ≪≫ρρ=P {( R, ), (N ,) }NDVI redN IR . Here, PNDVI is a dic -
tionary where the standard names ≪ N≫  and ≪ R≫  are keys and their values ρ i can be either single  
values or n-dimensional arrays.
This computation process is leveraged by the function computeIndex, which takes the acronym of the 
index ψ  and the dictionary of parameters Pψ  for the index computation as inputs. By doing this, computeIndex 
works on a higher level by computing ψ ψg P(, ) instead of ψψf EP(, ), which leverages the need of writing the com-
plete expression by just using the index acronym. ψE  is taken from the ≪formula≫  attribute in the local copy of 
the catalogue, although it can be requested directly from the online version in the updated catalogue. ψP  is passed 
by the user and must contain the same keys as Vψ . If this is not complied, the function will raise an error. In addi-
tion, the dictionary of parameters is interchangeable with keyword arguments for a more fluid scripting.
Multiple indices can be computed at once by passing a list of index acronyms Ψ⊆ Ψs  to the function.  
In this case, the dictionary of parameters is now P Pi
n
1si ∪= ψΨ = , where isψ ∈Ψ , and n  is the number of  
indices in Ψs . The function can then be computed as g P(, )s s
Ψ Ψ , which is easier and more efficient  
than computing ψ ψg P(, )i i
 for all ψ ∈Ψis . For example, in order to compute the Chlorophyll  
Index Red Edge (CIRE) 78, where ≪≫ ≪≫ρρ=P {( RE1, ), (N ,) }CIRE RE1N IR , and the NDVI, where 
≪≫ ≪≫ρρ=P {( R, ), (N ,) }NDVI redN IR , the required dictionary of parameters is now passed as 
∪ ρρ ρ= ≪≫ ≪≫ ≪≫P P {( R, ), (R E1 ,) ,( N, )}CIRE NDVI redR E1 NIR , and both indices can be computed at 
once by passing Ψ= ≪≫ ≪≫{C IRE, NDVI }s .
Generalized kernel indices can also be computed using computeIndex. However, to allow  
the optimization of kernel parameters, the computeKernel was created. This function permits users to  
compute a kernel K (a, b), where K  is a kernel function, and α  and b  can be whether reflectances  
or additional parameters. As an illustrative example, the kNDVI computation requires 
≪≫ ≪≫ρρ ρρ=P KK{( kNN, (, )),( kNR, (, ))}kNDVI NIRN IR NIRr ed , where K  can be any kernel function  
computed using the computeKernel method. Three kernel functions are implemented in spyndex. These 
kernels are (1) the Linear Kernel:
=Ka ba b(, ) (5)linear
(2) the Polynomial Kernel:

Ka ba bc(, )( ) (6)

where c is a trade-off parameter between higher and lower order terms in the polynomial and p is the polynomial

where σ  is the length-scale parameter. The K RBF  is suggested for the kNDVI computation with 
σρ ρ=. +05 () NIRr ed
22. However, the σ parameter can be chosen by the user in computeKernel, allowing the 
optimization of KRBF. This principle also applies for the c and p parameters in Kpoly.
Likewise, this is useful for the creation and optimization of generalized kernel indices. Since all indices can be 
kernelized22, the computeKernel function can be used for the required bands in kernelized indices that are 
being created and are not part of the catalogue yet. As an illustrative example, the Green Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index (GNDVI)74 can be kernelized as:

and all kernels in this equation can be easily computed by passing the corresponding ρNIR and ρgreen reflectances 
to computeKernel and selecting the desired kernel function with the required parameters for optimization.
Data r ecords
The ASI Catalogue (Fig. 2a) is a curated growing collection of currently 231 spectral indices (as of version 0.4.0) 
widely used in remote sensing. The catalogue is divided into 8 groups, which mostly represent specific appli -
cation domains (Fig. 1), namely: vegetation, water, burn, snow, urban, radar, soil, and kernel indices. Note that 
radar and kernel indices reflect specific methodological approaches. For instance, indices from any Earth system 
application domain could be converted to generalized kernel indices
22. However, we decided to create a group in 
its own right for indices of this kind since their mathematical structure involves a free parameterization.
The complete set of spectral indices per application domain (as of version 0.4.0) in JSON and CSV formats 
is available online via Zenodo168. The JSON file stores the catalogue using a key-value model, with the acronym 
of each index as the key and the set of 9 attributes as the value. The CSV file stores the catalogue as a relational 
model, with each row representing an index and the 9 attributes as columns. The data types for each attribute 
are listed in Table 4. Note that by modifying the original key-value model in the CSV file, the ≪ bands≫  and 
≪platforms ≫ attributes lose their array structure and additional string management must be done to recover it 
while keeping the relational model.
In addition to the set of spectral indices, two JSON files containing multiple attributes for the standard of 
each band as well as the additional parameters are included in the Zenodo repository. The JSON file for the 
bands includes the ≪long_name≫, ≪short_name ≫, ≪platforms ≫, ≪min_wavelength≫, and ≪max_wave
-
length≫  attributes. These attributes describe each one of the bands, including their spectral range and the set 
of platforms where the band is found. Furthermore, it includes the ≪common_name≫ attribute, which creates 
a direct mapping of the ASI standard to the Electro-Optical Extension Specification (see https://github.com/
stac-extensions/eo/) for SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogues (STAC). The JSON file for the additional parameters 
includes the ≪ default≫ , ≪ description≫ , and ≪ short_name≫  attributes. These attributes describe each one of 
the additional parameters, including the default value of the parameter in the original paper where it is found.
t echnical Validation
Catalogue validation. The living catalogue is continuously updated by the main developers based on rigor-
ous literature reviews. Users can request the addition of new indices by using issues or pull requests. All spectral 
indices are validated using pydantic169 (Fig. 2d), a Python package for data validation using type annotations. 
For this validation step, all indices must comply with the following constraints before being added to the cata-
logue: (1) All attributes must be filled with a string datatype, (2) ψ must be written in capital letters if possible and 
must not contain spaces, (3) E
ψ  must be a valid expression and must use items from the set of standards S  (see 
Expressions section), (4) dψ  must be in “YYYY-MM-DD” format, (5) cψ  must be a valid GitHub profile URL or an 
email, and (6) ∈ψo O. If the input indices do not comply with the above mentioned constraints the system raises 
an error and the catalogue is not updated until corrected. In the case of source references, the main developers 
review the reference provided by the contributor of an index. If the reference is not the original source of the 
index (e.g., a published paper, a poster, or grey literature), the index is not added to the catalogue until the original 
source is provided.
Compatibility with python objects. The expression evaluation taking mathematical overloaded operators 
into account makes it possible for different types of Python objects to be compatible with spyndex (Table  1). 
First, the primitive numerical Python built-in types int (integers) and float (floating points) are compatible 
with mathematical overloaded operators and thus compatible with spyndex. This primitive compatibility allows 
most Python objects that are built on top of them to be compatible with spyndex. Second, the primitive data 

9Scientific  Data  |          (2023) 10:197  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02096-0
www.nature.com/scientificdatawww.nature.com/scientificdata/
types in the numpy package170 (e.g., numpy.int and numpy.float) are also compatible with mathematical 
overloaded operators and therefore most Python objects built on top of numpy are also compatible with spyn-
dex (Fig. 2g).
This compatibility with the primitives of Python and numpy makes spyndex compatible with the most 
used objects: arrays and data frames. The primitive array objects can be created through numpy and they can 
be n-dimensional. These primitive arrays are the source of data arrays in the xarray package40, which allows 
the creation and manipulation of labelled data arrays and datasets. This is extremely useful for images with  
3 dimensions {columns, rows, bands}, or data cubes with 4 dimensions {columns, rows, bands, time}. By using 
xarray.DataArray objects as inputs in a spectral index calculation, the result will be another xarray.
DataArray with the same dimensions as the input arrays. If more than one index is calculated at the same 
time, by default, the result is a xarray.DataArray with an extra dimension named ≪ index≫  and the 
 
acronyms of the indices as labels.
Additionally, spyndex is also compatible with data frames in the pandas package171, which allows the cre-
ation and manipulation of tabular data, and geopandas172, which adds a spatial dimension to tabular data in 
pandas. Usually, the input data consist of pandas.Series or geopandas.Series, and the result would 
be another series with the same length when one index is computed. When multiple indices are computed, by 
default, the result is a pandas.DataFrame where each column corresponds to a spectral index.
This compatibility enables the direct use of SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogues (STAC) for spectral indices 
computation with spyndex, allowing the querying of satellite imagery from a STAC provider (e.g., Planetary 
Computer) and the direct computation of spectral indices for the requested images according to the data type in 
which the data is stored. Additionally, spyndex also extends the compatibility to Google Earth Engine (GEE) 
objects for its Python API
8. GEE is a cloud-based geoprocessing service that counts with a vast catalogue of 
satellite imagery that users can process online. Originally, GEE objects, such as ee.Image and ee.Number, 
are not compatible with mathematical overloaded operators. However, they are extended through the eemont 
package
173. This permits the spyndex compatibility with GEE objects for large spectral indices computations 
in the cloud.
Other objects can also be compatible with spyndex if mathematical overloaded operators are implemented 
for the object’s class. This is useful for users that aim to create their own classes or modules. By emulating numeric 
types, the created classes can serve as inputs for objects that are compatible for spectral indices computation. If 
the new classes are created by inheritance of classes that already have overloaded operators, the new classes are 
automatically compatible with spyndex (e.g., a new class named Signature that inherits from numpy.
ndarray and that represents a spectral signature can be used to compute spectral indices with spyndex).
Usage Notes
The potential of the ASI catalogue can be exploited to boost computations of spectral indices from real-world 
data using parallel computing and multidimensional data management through the spyndex Python library. 
Nevertheless, the machine readable catalogue can be used in further programming languages with a special 
potential for Earth system research. Furthermore, advanced applications involving hyperspectral indices or 
Machine Learning (ML) pipelines can also be exploited with ASI.
Python library usage examples. As the spyndex Python library works with any type of object that is 
compatible with overloaded operators, primitive types can be used to compute one or multiple spectral indices 
in a simple way. This is also true for more complex structures such as numpy.ndarray or pandas.Series 
objects (e.g. Figure 3). Nevertheless, real world applications usually require complex multidimensional objects 
that store several amounts of remote sensing data. Figure 4 shows an example where a Sentinel-2 L2A data cube 
for the year 2018 is retrieved as a xarray.DataArray given a specific pair of coordinates in the Hainich 
National Park, Germany, followed by the computation of NDVI, NIRv, and kNDVI.
Parallel computing. Remote sensing datasets are usually large, and calculating spectral indices can be com-
putationally expensive. For example, a single Sentinel-2 L2A image may have a data size of around 800 MB, 
which can increase by resampling the 20 and 60 m bands to 10 m, the highest spatial resolution of the MSI sensor.  
A multitemporal study using just Sentinel-2 imagery can easily overpass 1 TB of data, and appropriate scalability

is required to avoid delayed processing. Computing spectral indices by using GEE objects can leverage this to 
scale the satellite imagery processing, which is a transparent process for users. In the specific case of the GEE 
JavaScript API, users may use spectral
174, a module that extends the ASI catalogue to the Code Editor. 
However, when using Python, users may prefer to use arrays and data frames to have greater processing flexibil-
ity for remote sensing data. This is also useful when Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) modelling 
techniques are going to be applied.
To leverage this scalability, dask objects can be used in combination with numpy, xarray and pan -
das. dask is a library for parallel computing in Python that extends the arrays and data frame objects by 
using chunks of data in combination with a dynamic task scheduling. Since it extends the already known arrays 
and data frames, dask classes are also compatible with spyndex (Table 1), allowing their calculation in parallel 
computing instead of the usual serial computing. By using dask, spectral indices computation can be done 
in parallel and multiple indices computation at once becomes an advantage over serial computing of spectral 
indices (Fig. 5).
Computing spectral indices for multidimensional arrays. As Earth System Data Cubes (ESDC) are 
gaining strength in Earth system research2, spectral indices cubes can be added as new derived variables in them. 
Taking the vegetation application domain as example, here we present how ASI can be used for investigating the 
spatiotemporal spectral response of vegetation by using spectral indices at the ecosystem scale in the Hainich 
National Park, a Broadleaf Deciduous Forest (DBF) in central Germany
175. The spyndex Python library was 
used to compute several spectral indices for Sentinel-2 imagery. To exploit the potential of data cubes for Earth 
system research, we will describe this example by extending the concept of ESDC to Earth System Mini Cubes 
Fig. 3 Example code for computing NDVI and SAVI for float, numpy.ndarray, and pandas.Series objects. Both 
indices can be computed at the same time with the same input values. Furthermore, additional parameters such 
as the Canopy Background Adjustment L can be passed as a single constant value. Note that spyndex returns an 
object of the same type as the input objects.

(ESMC), i.e., data cubes with a small spatial extent, but with a higher spatiotemporal resolution than global data 
cubes).
Sentinel-2 L2A MSI data from the Hainich National Park was retrieved from the Microsoft’s Planetary 
Computer platform. All images were centered at the DE-Hai Eddy Covariance (EC) Tower176 from the Integrated 
Carbon Observation System (ICOS) and stored as a ESMC C L()S2  in zarr format, where L  is the set of  
Fig. 4 Example code for computing NDVI, NIRv, and kNDVI for a xarray.DataArray object. First, a Sentinel-2 
L2A data cube is retrieved as a data cube via the cubo Python package. This data cube is a chunked xarray.
DataArray with 4 dimensions: ≪bands≫, ≪time ≫, ≪x≫, and ≪y≫. The ≪bands ≫ dimension contains the 
labeled data for NIR and red surface reflectance values, therefore, it is used to select the values for each operand 
in the computation. Furthermore, this example displays how to compute a kernel for kernel indices such as the 
kNDVI. Note that the ≪kNN≫ operand was set to 1.0 since K
RBF was the selected kernel and KRBF(x, x) = 1.0.

dimensions of S2C , and L = {time, band, x, y}. The ESMC was preprocessed as follows: (1) the cube was cropped 
to a spatial extent of a 2.56  km radius around the EC tower, (2) the surface reflectance was adjusted to nadir 
BRDF reflectance using the c -factor approach 177– 179, (3) all bands were resampled to 10 m using the nearest 
neighbour algorithm, (4) clouds and cloud shadows were masked using the KappaMask L2A model 180, and  
(5) snow was masked using the Fmask algorithm181,182. The temporal resolution of the dataset is 1-day and covers 
the period 2016–2021. However, since the revisit time of the Sentinel-2 constellation only allows for an image 
every 2-5 days, most of the time steps are missing.
The mini cube L()S2C  was used to compute multiple spectral indices such that it was mapped to a spectral 
indices mini cube R()S2C , where R are the set of output dimensions, and R  = {time, index, x, y}. Since not all 
indices can be computed for Sentinel-2, a subset S2Ψ⊂ Ψ  was selected such that ≪ Sentinel-2≫  ∈ ψZ , where 
ψ ∈Ψ . L()S2C  was loaded as a chunked xarray.DataArray object and the spectral indices S2Ψ  were com-
puted in parallel using spyndex and dask. The additional optimizable parameters in spectral indices that 
required them were set to their default value according to the literature and the kernel indices were computed 
using

where ρ is the spatiotemporal univariate mini cube of bands i and j. Note that for σ the temporal dimension was 
reduced by mapping the median function across each pixel of the cube22,183. This applies not only for the kNDVI, 
but also for the remaining kernel indices.
For this document, we selected 9 spectral indices that use different bands from the visible, Red Edge, NIR and 
SWIR spectrum: (1) NDVI 13, (2) EVI 90, (3) kNDVI 22, (4) NDWI 16, (5) NIRv 21, (6) Normalized Difference 
Moisture Index (NDMI)148, (7) CIRE78, (8) IRECI24, and (9) Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDREI)72. 
The complete set of spectral indices ψs2 can be explored with the Leipzig Explorer of Earth Data Cubes (Lexcube, 
see https://www.lexcube.org/ ). Figure 6 shows the visualization of the 9 spectral indices for the DE-Hai site. 
Since all indices were computed from S2C , the shape of the x, y, and time dimensions are maintained for each 
index. As the time dimension was no regular in the original cube, the timesteps are not regular in the spectral 
indices cubes either. Note that there are visible gaps due to the cloud-, clouds shadow- and snow-masking for all 
cubes (i.e., NaN values are kept as they are when indices are computed).
This example demonstrates that multiple spectral indices can be computed for high-resolution data in multi
-
ple dimensions using the Python library of ASI. While this example shows how to compute indices for Sentinel-2

data, it can be naturally extended to coarser resolution data like MODIS or to finer resolution data like satellite 
imagery from Planet constellations. This shows the flexibility of ASI according to the study scale. Furthermore, 
the potential increases with the number of indices that can be computed. Here we presented 9 spectral indices 
representing combinations from all spectral regions available for the Sentinel-2 platform, but hundreds more 
can be computed from the same bands. Additionally, indices from different application domains can be applied 
to each other. In this case, WIs were computed for a vegetation application domain since the water absorption 
bands may give meaningful insights for monitoring vegetation states.
Spectral indices and platform capabilities. As shown before, the ASI catalogue is suitable for platforms 
that work on high spatial resolution datasets with a rich spectral resolution such as Sentinel-2. While this is true 
for the platform that was tested here, it can also serve multiple former platforms that were not mentioned, such as 
Landsat 1-5 with the MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection 
Radiometer (ASTER), MODIS, or even hyperspectral platforms like Hyperion EO-1. The use of these satellite 
platforms power up analyses from the global to the ecosystem scale. Nevertheless, these scales might not be suffi-
cient according to the problem-specific objective of an Earth system study (e.g., sub-pixel sampling, recurring 
time-sampling, higher spectral requirements). As an example, when looking at plots with a limited spatial extent 
(e.g., <100 m
2, which is the mixed area for each Sentinel-2 pixel), using airborne or drone imagery is one of the 
most useful approaches to take. While the spatial resolution can be significantly enhanced by using these plat-
forms (e.g., from meters to sub-centimetres), the spectral resolution may decrease as commercial RGB cameras 
are used in most cases, leaving most of the spectral indices out of reach according the platform specifications. 
However, spectral indices in the visible spectrum can still be computed for drone missions with RGB cameras 
since the ASI catalogue includes several spectral indices of this kind. The subset of spectral indices in the visible 
spectrum can be easily retrieved as 
VISΨ⊂ Ψ  such that ⊆ψVV VIS, where V VIS = {≪ B≫ , ≪ G≫ , ≪ R≫ }, e.g., 
Excess Green Index (ExG)149, Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (V ARI)77, Green Leaf Index (GLI)106, etc.
Computing hyperspectral and narrow-band indices. As a matter of simplicity, the ASI catalogue cur-
rently consists of broad-band spectral indices. Some narrow-band spectral indices as well as hyperspectral indices 
were coerced to broad-band indices if the specific wavelength was close to a common spectral band in popular 
multispectral sensors (Table 2). This rules out the need of the actual reflectance in the specific wavelength, but 
leaves a portion of narrow-band and hyperspectral indices out of the catalogue. Some hyperspectral indices have 
different variants that use slightly different wavelengths in their formulas and become completely omitted. One 
example is the Simple Ratio (SR), which has multiple variants that can be addressed one by one when exploit-
ing the Red Edge reflectance of vegetation
55,95,184,185. This also applies to complete application domains, as is the 
case of geology indices, which generally use several SWIR narrow-bands of ASTER for lithologic mapping 186. 
However, users can still use data from specific wavelengths by providing them in Pψ  when computing a spectral 
index that can be used as a hyperspectral index, such as the NDVI or the Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI). This is 
extensible to coerced hyperspectral indices in the catalogue, such as the Structure Insensitive Pigment Index 
(SIPI)
118 or the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI)83, where users can pass the 
actual data from specific wavelengths as parameters for the index computation.
Feeding machine learning pipelines. As data driven techniques are gaining strength in Earth system 
research, the ASI catalogue can power up ML models. For instance, classical ML approaches are regularly used for 
estimating bio-physical as well as bio-chemical variables from local to global scales
183,187–189. This includes linear 
regression models as well as non-linear approaches such as ensemble methods (e.g. Random Forest, Gradient 
Boosting, etc.), kernel methods (e.g. Support Vector Regression, SVR, Gaussian Processes, GP , etc.)
190,191, 
and probabilistic methods (e.g. Naive Bayes). As Python is highly used for ML (e.g., using packages such as 
scikit-learn
192; gpy, see http://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy ; XGBoost, see https://xgboost.ai/ ; etc.), the 
spyndex Python library fits in the pipeline by supporting several Python objects that are often used for these 
methods (e.g., arrays and data frames). This means that spectral indices can be directly calculated over the data-
set of interest and included as spectral features that can be even further pre-processed (e.g., computing textural 
features from spectral indices in 2-dimensional arrays) before being fed into a ML model. This principle applies 
for other pre-processing approaches in feature engineering such as dimensionality reduction. Since several spec-
tral indices can be computed for the same input bands, a new high-dimensional feature space can be derived. 
As multiple indices can be highly correlated, this feature space can be reduced to a latent one, either linearly or 
non-linearly.
Since multiple data driven approaches also include DL techniques, ASI can also be included in DL pipelines 
inside Python. As spectral indices can be computed for n-dimensional arrays, multiple types of architectures can 
be used for modelling a certain variable of interest or classifying land covers. For example, a fully connected neu-
ral network can be fed with tensors that contains several spectral indices of interest for Land Use Land Change 
(LULC) pixel-based mapping or GPP modelling188,189. However, an enhanced potential of DL can be achieved by 
considering the spatial and temporal dimensions when we talk about remote sensing. The spatial domain is cov-
ered by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can be fed with tensors from a 3-dimensional array. 
We can also grip time with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) architectures by adding a temporal dimension
193. 
Full potential can be described by taking the spatiotemporal dimension into consideration with 4-dimensional 
arrays
194. This can be effectively achieved by using different frameworks in Python, e.g., tensorflow195 and 
pytorch196, and exploiting the potential of ASI for handling spectral indices with n-dimensional data cubes.

Using aSI outside python. The Python library is designed to manage multiple Python objects, which 
makes it a great tool for spectral indices computation on data frames with pandas, or data cubes by using 
labelled data arrays with xarray. This is extremely important for Earth system research as many variables are 
usually distributed along a regular spatiotemporal grid. Remote sensing data structures can then be easily trans-
formed to fit these grids and spectral indices can be computed directly. In practice, this can be done in multiple 
programming languages and platforms, so their specific features as well as third-party libraries can be exploited. 
Given this, the ASI catalogue was already used to create a JavaScript module for the GEE Code Editor
174, which is 
extensively used in Earth system research. Nevertheless, two additionally and particularly relevant programming 
languages to use are R and Julia.
As R is a programming language with a big geospatial user-base, multiple packages for remote sensing have 
been created 197. This is the case of the sp package (see https://github.com/edzer/sp), where objects like the 
SpatialPixelsDataFrame can be used for storing multispectral data, permitting the computation of 
spectral indices. More specific packages such as raster (see https://github.com/rspatial/raster) provides users 
with the RasterLayer and RasterStack objects for a fully remote sensing focus. As it was mentioned 
before, there are already multiple R packages for computing spectral indices for these kind of objects. However, 
the whole potential for Earth system research can be achieved by using the ASI catalogue in combination with 
the stars package (see https://github.com/r-spatial/stars), specialised for spatiotemporal arrays (i.e., data 
cubes). On the other hand, primitive objects such as numeric types as well as vectors, arrays, and data frames 
can still be used for a comprehensive use of spectral indices in different objects inside R.
Julia is a programming language for high performance scientific computing, created with the goals of compos
-
ability and speed of execution198. The latter aspect specifically makes the language suitable for large Earth system 
applications, and this is shown by the high number of related packages available such as EarthDataLab.jl2,  
a package developed for ESDCs, and GeoStats.jl199, among others. Thanks to the multiple dispatch nature 
of Julia, primitive objects, such as arrays, can be extended, serving as input for spatiotemporal array objects for 
spectral indices computation. Examples include the Zarr.jl package (see https://github.com/JuliaIO/Zarr.jl), 
 
which provides an implementation of chunked n -dimensional arrays, or the YAXArrays.jl package (see 
https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/YAXArrays.jl), which can operate labeled data cubes from multiple data 
sources such as netCDF and zarr files. The thriving ML ecosystem in Julia has been growing and it now includes 
both production level software such as Flux.jl
200,201 as well as state of the art libraries for scientific ML202–204. 
This allows a seamless integration of these models with specific focus on Earth system research by using spectral 
indices from ASI, making the exploration of different modelling techniques quick and efficient.
